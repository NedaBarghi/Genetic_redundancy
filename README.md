## SNP_Calling_CMH_FET.sh

Command lines for SNP calling, SNP filteration steps, performing CMH and Fisher's exact tests are provided. The provided script for this step: 

```
call_SNP.py 
```

## estimate_Ne.sh

Command lines needed for estimation of effective population size (Ne). The provided scripts for this step:

```
compute_AF_cov_Ne.py
Ne_estimation.R
```
## neutral_simulations_FDR.sh

Command lines required for performing neutral simulations and estimation of false discovery rate corrected q-values of the CMH and Fisher's exact tests. The provided scripts for this step:

```
neutral_simulation_CMH.R
FDR_CMH.R

neutral_simulation_FET.R
FDR_FET.R
```
## Phenotypic analysis

Statistical analysis of phenotypic data are provided in the scripts:

```
fecundity_analysis.R
